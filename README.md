# Score Counter

## About
I created this application in Spring of 2020 alongside mt Todo List application when I started learning Web Development on my own. It was a project by Web Development course in Udemy instructed by Colt Steele. 

The Score Counter Web Application helps two people count their scores of how many times each won when playing a match. It can be a sport like Football or a card game like UNO. 

## Languages 
Languages used for this app are HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## Challenges/What I learnt 
1- Responsiveness has always been a great challenge. Even though using vh and vw worked for my other project, I think it was not useful for this project.

## Further Improvement 
1- Turning this Web Application to an iOS application would be a good idea.
